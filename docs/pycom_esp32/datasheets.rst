Deep Sleep Shield Schematic
---------------------------

The Deep sleep shield schematic is available on this `link <../_downloads/Deep-Sleep-Shield_Schematic.pdf>`_.


5.7 Powering with an external power source
==========================================

The modules can be powered by a battery or other external power source.

**Be sure to connect the positive lead of the power supply to VIN, and
ground to GND.**

- When powering via ``VIN``:

   **The input voltage must be between 3.4V and 5.5V.**

- When powering via ``3V3``:

   **The input voltage must be exactly 3V3, ripple free and from a supply capable
   of sourcing at least 500mA of current**

The battery connector for the expansion board is a **JST SH 2P** variant. The expansion board exposes the male connector and an external battery should use a femail adapter in order to connect and power the expansion board.

.. warning::

   The GPIO pins of the modules are NOT 5V tolerant, connecting them to voltages higher
   than 3.3V might cause irreparable damage to the board.

.. warning::
    Static electricity can shock the components on the module and destroy them. If you experience a lot of static electricity
    in your area (eg dry and cold climates), take extra care not to shock the module.  If your module came in a ESD bag, then
    this bag is the best way to store and carry the module as it will protect it against static discharges.
